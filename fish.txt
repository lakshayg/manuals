NAME
    fish -- friendly interactive shell

SETUP
    Fish is a convenient shell to use but it can be tricky to set it as a
    login shell. One of the problems I faced was that it does not source
    the ~/.zprofile on macOS. Here's the solution I ended up with:

    1. Leave the login shell unchanged (zsh)
    2. Set iterm startup cmd to zsh --login -c "exec /usr/local/bin/fish",
       this ensures that all the variables exported in ~/.zprofile are
       visible to fish

CUSTOMIZATION
    Install oh-my-fish: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish
    Install "cmorrell" theme: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-cmorrell.com
    Basic configuration in ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    * set -u fish_greeting                # disable greeting
    * set -u set fish_color_valid_path    # disable path underlining
    * export default_user=<username>      # for cmorrell theme
